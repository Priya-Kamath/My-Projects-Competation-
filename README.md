A 30-second commercial spot during the 2019 Super Bowl costs brands a whopping $5.1 million. Naturally, brands seek to monitor the performance of their ads. Traditional mechanisms such as the USA Today AD METER ratings were and still are the acceptable measuring yardstick. But with the advent of social media, channels such as Facebook and Twitter are able to provide digital footprints that enable additional in-depth understanding of consumer feedback in reaction to those ads. In this competition students apply business analytics skill and gain practical knowledge including data collection, data processing and cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. Technology learned includes PHP, MySQL, Python, MongoDB, Twitter API and Domo. Teams present the best infographics and white paper in relation to extracted insights from the Super Bowl ads.

Kaggle Competation

This was a Kaggle competition project to predict home values in IOWA. There is both a training dataset (1460 observations) and a test dataset(1459 observations) and the outcome variable is SalePrice which is omitted from the test data set. Having 79 explanatory variables like LotArea, Neighborhood, Overallqual the data set describes almost every aspect of residential homes in IOWA, and the challenge in this competition was to predict the final price of houses based on these predictors and how they influence the final price. The goal was to create a model that works well with test data whose performance will be judged by Root mean square error, R square and the score that got generated after uploading the file to Kaggle.
Our out of sample performance was an RMSE of .1255 and an R-squared of .9017. The in-sample performance was an RMSE of .1203 and a R-squared of .9095. Overall we achieved a RMSE of .1259 and an R-squared of .9011 on our test data set. With our submission to the Kaggle competition, we received a rank of 1673.
