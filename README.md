Game-Day-Analytics Challenge held by David Eccles School of Business
A 30-second commercial spot during the 2019 Super Bowl costs brands a whopping $5.1 million. Naturally, brands seek to monitor the performance of their ads. Traditional mechanisms such as the USA Today AD METER ratings were and still are the acceptable measuring yardstick. But with the advent of social media, channels such as Facebook and Twitter are able to provide digital footprints that enable additional in-depth understanding of consumer feedback in reaction to those ads. In this competition students apply business analytics skill and gain practical knowledge including data collection, data processing and cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. Technology learned includes PHP, MySQL, Python, MongoDB, Twitter API and Domo. Teams present the best infographics and white paper in relation to extracted insights from the Super Bowl ads.
